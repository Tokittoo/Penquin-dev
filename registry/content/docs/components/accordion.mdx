The Accordion - because sometimes your content needs to do yoga. This component is like a well-organized closet - everything's there, but it's not all hanging out at once. Perfect for FAQs, settings panels, or that one section of your app where you've crammed way too much information.

<ComponentShowcase component={
  <Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-[80%]">
      <AccordionItem value="item-1">
        <AccordionTrigger>Is it really that simple?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Yes. Yes it is. No magic tricks, no hidden complexity. Just pure, unadulterated accordion goodness.
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem value="item-2">
        <AccordionTrigger>Can I customize it?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Absolutely! It's like a chameleon, but for your UI. Change colors, sizes, animations - it's all fair game.
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem value="item-3">
        <AccordionTrigger>What about accessibility?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Built-in keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and screen reader support. We've got your back, and your users' too.
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
}
code={`'use client'
import { Accordion, AccordionContent, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger } from "@/components/ui/accordion"

      <AccordionItem value="item-1">
        <AccordionTrigger>Is it really that simple?</AccordionTrigger>

## Installation

First, make sure you have the required dependencies. The accordion is a bit of a social butterfly - it likes to have its friends around:


<InstallationCommand component={'accordion'} />


## Usage

Here's how to make your content do the accordion dance:

```tsx
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/accordion"

export function AccordionDemo() {
  return (
    <Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full">
      <AccordionItem value="item-1">
        <AccordionTrigger>Is it really that simple?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Yes. Yes it is. No magic tricks, no hidden complexity. Just pure, unadulterated accordion goodness.
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem value="item-2">
        <AccordionTrigger>Can I customize it?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Absolutely! It's like a chameleon, but for your UI. Change colors, sizes, animations - it's all fair game.
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem value="item-3">
        <AccordionTrigger>What about accessibility?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Built-in keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and screen reader support. We've got your back, and your users' too.
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
  )
}
```

## Props

The accordion comes with a few tricks up its sleeve:

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | `"single" \| "multiple"` | No | Whether to allow one or multiple items to be open at once. It's like choosing between monogamy and polyamory, but for your UI |
| `collapsible` | `boolean` | No | Whether all items can be closed. Sometimes you need a break from all that expanding and collapsing |
| `defaultValue` | `string \| string[]` | No | The default open item(s). Because even accordions need a starting point |
| `value` | `string \| string[]` | No | The controlled value. For when you want to be the boss of your accordion |
| `onValueChange` | `(value: string \| string[]) => void` | No | Callback when the value changes. It's like having a spy in your accordion |

## Features

- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions so smooth, they make butter jealous
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support because not everyone uses a mouse (and that's okay!)
- **Accessible**: ARIA attributes and screen reader support included, because we're not monsters
- **Customizable**: Style it to match your brand, or make it look like it came from the future
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety, because we like to keep things professional

## Common Issues

1. **"The accordion won't open!"** - Did you wrap your content in `AccordionContent`? It's like trying to open a door without a handle

2. **"The animations are janky!"** - Check if you've got any CSS conflicts. The accordion is sensitive about its appearance

3. **"It's not working with my state management!"** - Remember, the accordion can be controlled or uncontrolled. Choose your own adventure!
