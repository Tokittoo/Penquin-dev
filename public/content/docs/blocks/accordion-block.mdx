The Accordion Block - because sometimes your FAQ section needs to look like it was designed by someone who actually cares about user experience. This block combines our beloved accordion component with a headline to create a beautiful, animated section that's perfect for FAQs, feature explanations, or that one part of your website where you've crammed way too much information.

<ComponentShowcase component={
  <AccordionBlock
    className="scale-60"
    title=<>Frequently<br />Asked<br />Questions</>
    accordionItems={[
      {
        trigger: "Is it really that simple?",
        content: "Yes. Yes it is. No magic tricks, no hidden complexity. Just pure, unadulterated accordion goodness."
      },
      {
        trigger: "Can I customize it?",
        content: "Absolutely! It's like a chameleon, but for your UI. Change colors, sizes, animations - it's all fair game."
      },
      {
        trigger: "What about accessibility?",
        content: "Built-in keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and screen reader support. We've got your back, and your users' too."
      }
    ]}
  />
}
code={`import AccordionBlock from "@/components/block/accordion-block"

export function AccordionBlockDemo() {
  return (
    <AccordionBlock
      title=<>Frequently<br />Asked<br />Questions</>
      accordionItems={[
        {
          trigger: "Is it really that simple?",
          content: "Yes. Yes it is. No magic tricks, no hidden complexity."
        },
        {
          trigger: "Can I customize it?",
          content: "Absolutely! It's like a chameleon, but for your UI."
        },
        {
          trigger: "What about accessibility?",
          content: "Built-in keyboard navigation and screen reader support."
        }
      ]}
    />
  )
}`} />

## Installation

First, make sure you have the required dependencies. The accordion block is a bit of a social butterfly - it likes to have its friends around:


<InstallationCommand component={'accordion-block'} />


## Usage

Here's how to make your FAQ section look like it was designed by a professional:

```tsx
import AccordionBlock from "@/components/block/accordion-block"

export function FAQSection() {
  return (
    <AccordionBlock
      title="Frequently Asked Questions"
      accordionItems={[
        {
          trigger: "Is it really that simple?",
          content: "Yes. Yes it is. No magic tricks, no hidden complexity."
        },
        {
          trigger: "Can I customize it?",
          content: "Absolutely! It's like a chameleon, but for your UI."
        },
        {
          trigger: "What about accessibility?",
          content: "Built-in keyboard navigation and screen reader support."
        }
      ]}
    />
  )
}
```

## Props

The accordion block comes with a few tricks up its sleeve:

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | `React.ReactNode` | Yes | The title of your accordion section. Can be a string or any React node |
| `accordionItems` | `AccordionItemType[]` | Yes | Array of items to display in the accordion |
| `className` | `string` | No | Additional CSS classes for custom styling |

### AccordionItemType

```tsx
type AccordionItemType = {
  trigger: string,  // The text that appears in the accordion trigger
  content: string   // The content that appears when the accordion is opened
}
```

## Features

- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions so smooth, they make butter jealous
- **Responsive Layout**: Looks great on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop
- **Animated Title**: The headline animates into view when the section is visible
- **Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Customizable**: Style it to match your brand, or make it look like it came from the future
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety, because we like to keep things professional

## Common Issues

1. **"The animations aren't working!"** - Make sure you have the `motion` package installed and properly configured

2. **"The layout looks weird!"** - Check if you've got any CSS conflicts. The block is sensitive about its appearance

3. **"The title isn't animating!"** - Ensure the block is within the viewport. It only animates when it becomes visible
