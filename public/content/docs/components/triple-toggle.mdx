import { InstallationCommand } from '../../components/InstallationCommand.tsx'
import { TripleToggleShowcase } from '../../components/specificComponentShowcase/TripleToggleShowcase'
import { ComponentShowcase } from '../../components/ComponentShowcase.tsx'

The Triple Toggle - a toggle component that's not satisfied with just being on or off. It needs more drama in its life because sometimes a regular toggle just isn't extra enough. Perfect for scenarios where you need multiple options, like choosing between different subscription plans or billing cycles.

<ComponentShowcase component={<TripleToggleShowcase />} code={`
import { TripleToggle } from "@/components/ui/triple-toggle"

const PlanToggle = () => {
  const [plan, setPlan] = React.useState("Free");

  return (
    <TripleToggle
      options={{
        main: "Free",
        grouped: {
          title: "Premium",
          subOptions: ["Monthly", "Yearly"]
        }
      }}
      value={plan}
      toggleOptions={setPlan}
    />
  )
}`} />


## Installation

First, make sure you have the required dependencies. This component is a bit high-maintenance:


<InstallationCommand component={'triple-toggle'} />


## Usage

Here's how to use this drama queen of a component:

```tsx
import { TripleToggle } from "@/components/ui/triple-toggle"

// Your component
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("Monthly")

  return (
    <TripleToggle
      options={{
        main: "Monthly",
        grouped: {
          title: "Billing",
          subOptions: ["Yearly", "Lifetime"]
        }
      }}
      value={value}
      toggleOptions={setValue}
    />
  )
}
```

## Props

The component accepts the following props:

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `options` | `{ main: string, grouped: { title: string, subOptions: [string, string] } }` | Yes | Configuration object that defines the toggle's options and structure. |
| `value` | `string` | Yes | The currently selected value. |
| `toggleOptions` | `(value: string) => void` | Yes | Callback function that handles value changes. |
| `className` | `string` | No | Additional CSS classes for custom styling. |

### Options Object Structure

```tsx
{
  main: string,           // The main option (e.g., "Monthly" in a pricing toggle)
  grouped: {
    title: string,        // The title that appears on hover (e.g., "Premium")
    subOptions: [string, string]  // Two sub-options (e.g., ["Monthly", "Yearly"])
  }
}
```

## Features

- **Smooth Animations**: Because we're not savages who use abrupt transitions
- **Responsive Design**: It looks good on all screen sizes, unlike some of your ex's selfies
- **Accessible**: It's keyboard-friendly, because not everyone uses a mouse (shocking, I know)
- **Dark Mode Support**: It works in the dark, unlike your plants`1

## Common Issues

1. **"The toggle isn't moving!"** - Double-check that all required props are provided correctly

2. **"The animations are janky!"** - Ensure you have the latest version of `motion` installed

3. **"It's not working in dark mode!"** - Verify your theme configuration is properly set up
