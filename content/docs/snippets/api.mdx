title: Standard API Response and Error
---

import { InstallationCommand } from '../../components/InstallationCommand.tsx'

Because who doesn't love standardized responses? Let's make your API responses as predictable as your morning coffee routine.

## Installation
<InstallationCommand component={'api-response-and-error'} />

## ApiResponse

Ah, the `ApiResponse` class - your API's way of saying "I'm not dead, I promise!" This class is like that friend who always responds to your texts, even if it's just to say "k".

### Usage

```tsx
import { ApiResponse } from '@/utils/apiResponse'

// When everything goes right (which is never, but let's pretend)
const successResponse = new ApiResponse(200, { data: "I'm working, I swear!" })

// When you're not sure what's happening (which is always)
const confusedResponse = new ApiResponse(418, null, "I'm a teapot, not a coffee maker!")
```

### Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `statusCode` | `number` | The HTTP status code that tells your frontend whether to celebrate or cry |
| `data` | `Record<string, unknown> \| null` | The actual data (if any) that your frontend will probably ignore anyway |
| `message` | `string` | A friendly message that no one will read |
| `success` | `boolean` | A boolean that's automatically set based on whether your status code is less than 400 (because who needs explicit success flags?) |

## ApiError

Meet `ApiError`, the class that makes your frontend developers cry. It's like `Error`, but with extra steps and more ways to tell you that something went wrong.

### Usage

```tsx
import { ApiError } from '@/utils/apiError'

// When your database is having an existential crisis
const dbError = new ApiError(500, "The database is questioning its life choices")

// When your user tries to access something they shouldn't
const authError = new ApiError(403, "Nice try, but you're not getting in here", ["Missing permissions", "Invalid token"])
```

### Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `statusCode` | `number` | The HTTP status code that tells your frontend exactly how much trouble they're in |
| `message` | `string` | A message that will make your users feel bad about themselves |
| `success` | `boolean` | Always `false` because if it was `true`, you wouldn't be using this class |
| `errors` | `string[]` | An array of additional error messages, because one error is never enough |

## Why Use These?

- **Consistency**: Because nothing says "professional" like consistent error messages
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript will yell at you if you try to do something stupid (which you probably will)
- **Debugging**: When things go wrong (and they will), you'll know exactly who to blame
- **User Experience**: Your users will love getting the same error message in 50 different ways

## Best Practices

1. Always use meaningful status codes (because 418 is more fun than 400)
2. Keep error messages short and sweet (or long and passive-aggressive)
3. Use the `errors` array to list every single thing that went wrong (your users love reading)
4. Remember: if your API is working perfectly, you're probably doing something wrong

## Example

```tsx
// The perfect API response (it doesn't exist, but we can dream)
const perfectResponse = new ApiResponse(200, {
  data: "Everything is working as expected",
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  unicorns: "ðŸ¦„"
})

// The reality (this is what you'll actually get)
const reality = new ApiError(500, "The server is having a bad day", [
  "Database connection failed",
  "Cache is having an existential crisis",
  "The coffee machine is broken"
])
```

Remember: in the world of APIs, the only constant is that something will always go wrong. But with these classes, at least it'll go wrong in a standardized way! ðŸŽ‰
