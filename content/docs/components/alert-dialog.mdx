import { InstallationCommand } from '../../components/InstallationCommand.tsx'
import { AlertDialog, AlertDialogAction, AlertDialogCancel, AlertDialogContent, AlertDialogDescription, AlertDialogFooter, AlertDialogHeader, AlertDialogTitle, AlertDialogTrigger } from '@/../registry/components/ui/alert-dialog'
import { ComponentShowcase } from '../../components/ComponentShowcase.tsx'

The Alert Dialog - because sometimes you need to make sure your users really, really want to do something. It's like having a responsible friend who double-checks before you make that questionable life decision. Perfect for those "Are you sure?" moments that could save your users from themselves.

<ComponentShowcase component={
  <AlertDialog>
    <AlertDialogTrigger className="px-4 py-2 bg-neutral-900 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-neutral-800">
      Delete Account
    </AlertDialogTrigger>
    <AlertDialogContent>
      <AlertDialogHeader>
        <AlertDialogTitle>Are you absolutely sure?</AlertDialogTitle>
        <AlertDialogDescription>
          This action cannot be undone. This will permanently delete your account and remove your data from our servers.
        </AlertDialogDescription>
      </AlertDialogHeader>
      <AlertDialogFooter>
        <AlertDialogCancel>Cancel</AlertDialogCancel>
        <AlertDialogAction>Delete</AlertDialogAction>
      </AlertDialogFooter>
    </AlertDialogContent>
  </AlertDialog>
} code={`const DeleteAccountDialog = () => {
  return (
    <AlertDialog>
      <AlertDialogTrigger>Delete Account</AlertDialogTrigger>
      <AlertDialogContent>
        <AlertDialogHeader>
          <AlertDialogTitle>Are you absolutely sure?</AlertDialogTitle>
          <AlertDialogDescription>
            This action cannot be undone. This will permanently delete your account
            and remove your data from our servers.
          </AlertDialogDescription>
        </AlertDialogHeader>
        <AlertDialogFooter>
          <AlertDialogCancel>Cancel</AlertDialogCancel>
          <AlertDialogAction>Delete</AlertDialogAction>
        </AlertDialogFooter>
      </AlertDialogContent>
    </AlertDialog>
  )
}`} />

## Installation

First, make sure you have the required dependencies. This component is a bit high-maintenance, but it's worth it for the peace of mind:


<InstallationCommand component={'alert-dialog'} />


## Usage

Here's how to add that extra layer of security (and drama) to your app:

```tsx
import {
  AlertDialog,
  AlertDialogAction,
  AlertDialogCancel,
  AlertDialogContent,
  AlertDialogDescription,
  AlertDialogFooter,
  AlertDialogHeader,
  AlertDialogTitle,
  AlertDialogTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/alert-dialog"

// Your component
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <AlertDialog>
      <AlertDialogTrigger>Open Dialog</AlertDialogTrigger>
      <AlertDialogContent>
        <AlertDialogHeader>
          <AlertDialogTitle>Are you sure?</AlertDialogTitle>
          <AlertDialogDescription>
            This action cannot be undone.
          </AlertDialogDescription>
        </AlertDialogHeader>
        <AlertDialogFooter>
          <AlertDialogCancel>Cancel</AlertDialogCancel>
          <AlertDialogAction>Continue</AlertDialogAction>
        </AlertDialogFooter>
      </AlertDialogContent>
    </AlertDialog>
  )
}
```

## Components

The Alert Dialog is made up of several parts, each with its own role in the drama:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `AlertDialog` | The main container. It's like the stage for your confirmation drama |
| `AlertDialogTrigger` | The button that opens the dialog. The instigator of the whole situation |
| `AlertDialogContent` | The actual dialog box. Where the magic (and the stress) happens |
| `AlertDialogHeader` | Contains the title and description. The "serious talk" section |
| `AlertDialogTitle` | The main message. Usually something that makes users think twice |
| `AlertDialogDescription` | Additional context. Because sometimes users need a little more convincing |
| `AlertDialogFooter` | Contains the action buttons. Where users make their final decision |
| `AlertDialogAction` | The primary action button. The "point of no return" |
| `AlertDialogCancel` | The secondary action button. The "get out of jail free" card |

## Features

- **Accessible**: Works with keyboard and screen readers, because not everyone uses a mouse
- **Animated**: Smooth transitions that make the drama more bearable
- **Customizable**: Style it to match your app's personality
- **Responsive**: Looks good on all screens, unlike some of your ex's selfies

## Common Issues

1. **"The dialog isn't opening!"** - Make sure you've wrapped everything in an `AlertDialog` component. It's like trying to have a conversation without opening your mouth

2. **"The buttons aren't styled!"** - Add your own classes to `AlertDialogAction` and `AlertDialogCancel`. Even buttons need to look their best

3. **"It's not centered!"** - The component handles centering automatically. It's like having a personal assistant for your UI
