The Dark Mode Toggle - because your eyes deserve better than staring at a bright screen at 3 AM. This component is like a light switch, but for your entire app. It's the hero we need, not the one we deserve.

<ComponentShowcase component={<DarkModeToggleShowcase />} code={`
'use client'
import { useTheme } from "next-themes";
import { DarkModeToggle } from "@/registry/components/ui/dark-mode-toggle"

export const DarkModeToggleShowcase = () => {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();
  const toggleDark = () => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');

  return <DarkModeToggle toggleDark={toggleDark} />
}`} />

## Installation

First, make sure you have the required dependencies. This component is a bit of a diva - it needs its theme provider:


<InstallationCommand component={'dark-mode-toggle'} />


## Usage

Here's how to bring the darkness (or light) to your app:

```tsx
'use client'

import { useTheme } from "next-themes";
import { DarkModeToggle } from "@/registry/components/ui/dark-mode-toggle"

export const DarkModeToggleShowcase = () => {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();
  const toggleDark = () => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');

  return <DarkModeToggle toggleDark={toggleDark} />
}
```

## Props

The component is refreshingly simple - it's like a light switch, but without the confusing "which way is on?" part:

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `toggleDark` | `() => void` | Yes | The function that handles the theme toggle. It's like the component's personal assistant, doing all the heavy lifting |
| `className` | `string` | No | Additional CSS classes. Because even dark mode toggles need a makeover sometimes |

## Features

- **Smooth Transitions**: Because sudden theme changes are so 2010
- **Persistent Theme**: Remembers your preference, unlike your ex
- **Accessible**: Works with keyboard and screen readers, because not everyone uses a mouse
- **Responsive**: Looks good on all screen sizes, unlike some of your selfies

## Common Issues

1. **"The toggle isn't working!"** - Did you wrap your app in a `ThemeProvider`? It's like trying to turn on a light without electricity

2. **"The theme isn't persisting!"** - Check if you've set up your theme storage correctly. The component has commitment issues

3. **"It's not working in dark mode!"** - That's... that's the point of the component
