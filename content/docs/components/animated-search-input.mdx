import { AnimatedSearchInputShowcase } from '../../components/specificComponentShowcase/AnimatedSearchInputShowcase'
import { ComponentShowcase } from '../../components/ComponentShowcase.tsx'

The Animated Search Input - because regular search inputs are so 2010. This component is like having a search bar that's been to acting school - it knows how to make an entrance and keep your users entertained while they type. Perfect for when you want to add a little flair to your search experience.

<ComponentShowcase component={<AnimatedSearchInputShowcase />} code={`
'use client'

import React from 'react'
import { AnimatedSearchInput } from '@/registry/components/ui/animated-search-input'

export const AnimatedSearchInputShowcase = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("");

  const placeholders =[
    "Search for anything...",
    "Try 'react components'",
    "Or maybe 'UI libraries'?",
    "How about 'animated inputs'?"
  ]

  return (
    <AnimatedSearchInput
      placeholders={placeholders}
      value={value}
      setValue={setValue}
      onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
    />
  )
}`} />

## Installation

First, make sure you have the required dependencies. This component is a bit of a performer - it needs its animation library:


<InstallationCommand component={'animated-search-input'} />


## Usage

Here's how to add some drama to your search experience:

```tsx
'use client'

import React from 'react' 
import { AnimatedSearchInput } from "@/components/ui/animated-search-input"

// Your component
export const MyComponent = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("");

  const placeholders = [
    "Search for anything...",
    "Try 'react components'",
    "Or maybe 'UI libraries'?",
    "How about 'animated inputs'?"
  ]

  return (
    <AnimatedSearchInput
      placeholders={placeholders}
      value={value}
      setValue={setValue}
      onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
    />
  )
}
```

## Props

The component comes with a few options to make your search bar the star of the show:

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `placeholders` | `string[]` | Yes | An array of placeholder texts that will animate in sequence. The more, the merrier! |
| `value` | `string` | Yes | The current value of the input. It's like the script for our little performance |
| `setValue` | `(val: string) => void` | Yes | Function to update the input value. The director of our show |
| `haltDuration` | `number` | No | How long to pause between placeholder animations (in seconds). For dramatic effect |
| `enableTabCompletion` | `boolean` | No | Whether to allow tab completion of the current placeholder. Like having a helpful understudy |
| `className` | `string` | No | Additional CSS classes. For when you need that extra pizzazz |

## Features

- **Animated Placeholders**: Smooth transitions between different placeholder texts
- **Tab Completion**: Press tab to complete the current placeholder. It's like having a mind reader
- **Responsive Design**: Looks good on all screens, unlike some of your ex's selfies
- **Dark Mode Ready**: Works in the light and the dark, just like a good spy
- **Accessible**: Works with keyboard and screen readers, because not everyone uses a mouse

## Common Issues

1. **"The animations aren't working!"** - Make sure you've provided an array of `placeholders`. It's like trying to perform without a script

2. **"The input isn't updating!"** - Check if you've properly set up the `value` and `setValue` props. It's like having actors without a stage

3. **"The placeholders are too fast/slow!"** - Adjust the `haltDuration` prop. Sometimes you need to find the right tempo for your performance
