The Toggle - a classic binary switch that's been around since the dawn of UI design. Simple, elegant, and always ready to flip between states. It's like a light switch, but for your digital world.

<ComponentShowcase component={<ToggleShowcase />} code={`const ThemeToggle = () => {
  const [isDark, setIsDark] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <Toggle
      isOn={isDark}
      toggleOn={() => setIsDark(!isDark)}
    />
  )
}`} />

## Installation

First, make sure you have the required dependencies:


<InstallationCommand component={'toggle'} />


## Usage

Here's how to implement this trusty component:

```tsx
import { Toggle } from "@/components/ui/toggle"

// Your component
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isEnabled, setIsEnabled] = React.useState(false)

  return (
    <Toggle
      isOn={isEnabled}
      toggleOn={() => setIsEnabled(!isEnabled)}
    />
  )
}
```

## Props

The component accepts these straightforward props:

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `isOn` | `boolean` | Yes | The current state of the toggle (true for on, false for off) |
| `toggleOn` | `() => void` | Yes | Callback function that handles the toggle state change |
| `className` | `string` | No | Additional CSS classes for custom styling |

## Features

- **Smooth Animations**: Elegant transitions that make state changes feel natural
- **Responsive Design**: Looks crisp on any screen size
- **Accessible**: Fully keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly
- **Dark Mode Support**: Adapts to your theme preferences with style

## Common Issues

1. **"The toggle isn't moving!"** - Make sure you've provided both `isOn` and `toggleOn` props

2. **"The animations are janky!"** - Check if you have the latest version of `motion` installed

3. **"It's not working in dark mode!"** - Verify your theme configuration is properly set up
