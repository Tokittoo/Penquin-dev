title: Who did this?
---

Ah, the age-old question! ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm the person who got tired of writing the same utility functions for the 69th time and decided to do something about it. You know that feeling when you're building something amazing, and suddenly you hit a roadblock that makes you question your life choices? Yeah, that's what led to Vynk.

### Why I Created This

- Got tired of Googling "how to center a div" for the 420th time
- Wanted to save future me from the pain of debugging the same issues
- Realized I was writing more boilerplate than actual code
- Had an existential crisis about why we keep reinventing the wheel
- Decided to channel my inner lazy developer into something productive

### The Vynk Philosophy

Look, we've all been there. You're building something awesome, and suddenly you need to:
- Handle that pesky form validation (again)
- Set up that authentication flow (for the nth time)
- Create those beautiful UI components (that you'll probably never use)
- Write those utility functions (that you'll forget about in a week)

That's where Vynk comes in. It's like a time capsule of "I don't want to do this again" moments. Every time you find yourself thinking, "Man, I wish I had this from my last project," that's a perfect candidate for Vynk.

### Open Source? You Bet!

Vynk is (or will be soon) open source! ðŸŽ‰ Because let's face it, the best way to build something amazing is to let other developers who are equally tired of reinventing the wheel contribute to it. Think of it as a collective effort to make the development world a slightly less painful place.

### How You Can Help

Found something that made you question your career choices? Perfect! That's exactly what we want. Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Share Your Pain**: Found a solution to a problem that made you want to throw your computer out the window? Share it!
2. **Save Others**: Help other developers avoid the same existential crisis you went through
3. **Build Together**: Because misery loves company, and great code loves collaboration
4. **Open Source Hero**: Star the repo, fork it, submit PRs, or just watch it grow (we won't judge, we're just happy you're here!)

Remember: The best contributions come from developers who are tired of doing the same thing over and over again. If you've ever thought, "There has to be a better way," you're already thinking like a Vynk contributor! ðŸš€

*P.S. If you're reading this and thinking, "This person needs help," you're probably right. But hey, at least I'm trying to make the development world a slightly less painful place, one utility function at a time! And with your help, we can make it even better! ðŸ˜‰*
